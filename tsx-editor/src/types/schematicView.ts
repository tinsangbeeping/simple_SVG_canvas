/**
 * schematicView.ts
 * ────────────────
 * The SCHEMATIC VIEW GRAPH — how the circuit is drawn on screen.
 * This layer answers "where is it drawn and how does it look."
 *
 * Frozen schema note:
 *   The repo-wide canonical schema now lives in src/types/schematicModel.ts.
 *   This file remains the geometry/view-focused projection of that split model.
 *
 * Key invariants:
 *   1. SAME NET ≠ SAME VISIBLE WIRE
 *      A visible wire must be declared explicitly here to be drawn.
 *      Netlabels and power symbols do NOT generate wires.
 *
 *   2. ELK ANCHORS ≠ SCHEMATIC POSITIONS
 *      ELK-generated coordinates are layout hints stored here temporarily
 *      during auto-layout. They are NEVER exported to tscircuit JSX.
 *
 *   3. netlabels / power symbols → NEVER become ELK routing nodes
 *      They provide only electrical merging (in ElectricalTruthGraph)
 *      and a placed symbol (in this file). The ELK layout engine must
 *      exclude them from its routing graph.
 *
 * Export mapping (this file → tscircuit JSX):
 *   ViewWire              → <trace from="A" to="B" />
 *   ViewNetLabel          → <netlabel net="NAME" />
 *   ViewPowerSymbol       → <trace from="." to="net.GND" /> (+ rendered symbol)
 *   ViewSheetPort         → referenced in trace selectors, never standalone tag
 *   ELK positions/anchors → NEVER exported
